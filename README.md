# Unity-Game-Monster-Evolution
This is a personal project I make for learning purposes.
Description: Developed an in-progress game titled "Monster Evolution," inspired by the mechanics of vampire-survivor games. In this game, players control a character from a top-down view and face waves of enemies approaching from all directions. Key features include:
•	Character Progression: Players gain experience points (EXP) by defeating enemies, which allows them to level up and upgrade their weapons and abilities.
•	Survival Mechanics: The objective is to survive for a set duration to complete each level, with increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
•	Variety of Levels: The game includes multiple levels, each with unique challenges and enemy types.

Skills: Unity Development, C# Programming, Game Design Principles, 2D Graphics, UI/UX Development, Audio Integration, Asset Management, Game Testing.
